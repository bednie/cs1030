In the Files section is a Folder named PROGRAM2, and the file is named LotsOfNumbers.txt. It contains lots of integers, how many? That's for you to find out.

Assume the file is "clean data", meaning there are no negative numbers, no alphabetic characters, only digits. 

Write a program to determine 
1) how many integers in the file 
2) the sum total of all the integers
3) average of all the integers

Write these three values, one on each line with an appropriate description to a text file named "Program2.out"

Zip your python program and the output file together then submit on Canvas no later than Sunday, Oct 23.

Notes: Make sure your python program and the LotsOfNumbers.txt are in the same folder/directory when you run the program.

Grading:
10 Correct input and output file handling
10 Correct calculations for counting integers, sum total and the average

Extra Credit + 5 points
Instead of hard-coding the file name LotsOfNumbers.txt, ask the user for the file name. If you take this approach, make sure you check that the file exists!
